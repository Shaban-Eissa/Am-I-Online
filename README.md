- **TypeScript**: Full type safety

## Why We Built This Application üåê

### The Real Problem: Unreliable Connectivity Detection

**Traditional methods are fundamentally flawed:**
- **Ping (ICMP) only checks basic network connectivity** - it doesn't verify if you can actually access web services
- **A device could respond to ping but still fail to load web pages** - this is a common scenario in corporate networks, captive portals, or when DNS is broken
- **Many networks block ICMP packets** - making ping completely useless
- **Doesn't confirm actual internet access** - just that a device is reachable

### Why This Matters Now More Than Ever üìà

In today's interconnected world:
- **Remote work** depends on reliable internet connectivity
- **Cloud services** require constant internet access
- **IoT devices** need to know when they're online
- **Web applications** must gracefully handle connectivity changes
- **Network troubleshooting** requires accurate diagnostic tools

This application provides a **reliable, real-world solution** to a fundamental problem that affects everyone who uses the internet. It's not just a demo - it's a practical tool that demonstrates the right way to detect internet connectivity in modern applications.

## The Problem: Traditional Methods Fail

### Why Ping (ICMP) Doesn't Work

**Common Approach: Ping DNS Servers**
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8    # Google DNS
ping 1.1.1.1    # Cloudflare DNS
```

**Problems with Ping (ICMP Protocol):**
- ‚ùå Only checks basic network connectivity
- ‚ùå Doesn't verify full HTTP stack (DNS ‚Üí TCP ‚Üí HTTP)
- ‚ùå A device could respond to ping but still fail to load web pages
- ‚ùå Many networks block ICMP packets
- ‚ùå Doesn't confirm actual internet access

**Goal:** Check internet access at the application level like a real HTTP client.

## The Solution: HTTP-Based Connectivity Checks

### Industry-Standard Approach

This application implements the **industry-standard approach** used by major tech companies:

- **Google Chrome** uses `http://google.com/generate_204` for connectivity detection
- **Cloudflare** provides `http://cp.cloudflare.com/generate_204` 
- **Microsoft** uses `http://edge-http.microsoft.com/captiveportal/generate_204`
- **Ubuntu** has `http://connectivity-check.ubuntu.com`

### Why This Approach Works Better

‚úÖ **Verifies the complete network path**: DNS ‚Üí TCP ‚Üí HTTP  
‚úÖ **Confirms actual internet access** - not just network connectivity  
‚úÖ **Works behind corporate firewalls** - uses standard HTTP ports  
‚úÖ **Minimal resource usage** - 204 responses have no content  
‚úÖ **Global infrastructure** - hosted on reliable, worldwide networks  

### How generate_204 Endpoints Work üéØ

**Google Chrome's Method:**
```bash
http://google.com/generate_204
https://google.com/generate_204
```

**What Happens:**
- Returns HTTP 204 (No Content) ‚Üí means success with no response body
- Very fast and reliable because it runs on core Google infrastructure
- Confirms the full network path works:
  - DNS resolution
  - TCP connection
  - HTTP response

**Why HTTP 204?**
- No content ‚Üí minimal data usage
- Ideal for quick connectivity checks
- Browsers show blank page (expected behavior)

### Industry-Standard Connectivity Endpoints üåç

| Provider | URL | Expected Status | Notes |
|----------|-----|----------------|-------|
| **Google** | `http://google.com/generate_204` | 200, 204 | Most reliable, global infrastructure |
| **Cloudflare** | `http://cp.cloudflare.com/generate_204` | 200, 204 | Fast CDN, excellent worldwide coverage |
| **Microsoft** | `http://edge-http.microsoft.com/captiveportal/generate_204` | 200, 204 | Windows NCSI compatible |
| **Ubuntu** | `http://connectivity-check.ubuntu.com` | 200 | Linux system connectivity checks |

### Testing Endpoints Manually üîç

```bash
# Test Google's endpoint
curl -I http://google.com/generate_204
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

# Test Cloudflare's endpoint
curl -I http://cp.cloudflare.com/generate_204
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

# Test with User-Agent (for picky endpoints)
curl -I http://edge-http.microsoft.com/captiveportal/generate_204 \
  -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
```

## Real-World Use Cases üåç

### **For Developers & IT Professionals:**
- **Debug network issues** - quickly identify if connectivity problems are local or global
- **Monitor service availability** - track uptime and response times
