# Am I Online? üåê

A modern, real-time internet connectivity monitoring application built with Angular 19, Signals, and modern web technologies. This application demonstrates reliable internet connectivity detection using industry-standard endpoints and provides comprehensive network monitoring capabilities.

## Features ‚ú®

### üîç Real-time Connectivity Monitoring
- **Multiple Endpoint Testing**: Tests connectivity against Google, Cloudflare, Microsoft, and Ubuntu endpoints
- **Automatic Fallback**: If one endpoint fails, automatically tries the next one
- **Response Time Measurement**: Tracks and displays connection response times
- **Automatic Checks**: Performs connectivity checks every 30 seconds
- **Reliable Detection**: Uses HTTP-based connectivity checks instead of unreliable ping methods

### üìä Network Statistics
- **Uptime Percentage**: Shows overall connection reliability
- **Average Response Time**: Displays mean response time across all successful connections
- **Connection History**: Tracks recent connection attempts with timestamps
- **Performance Charts**: Visual representation of response time trends

### üöÄ Technical Excellence
- **Angular 19**: Latest Angular version with standalone components
- **Signals**: Modern reactive state management
- **OnPush Change Detection**: Optimized performance
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety

## The Problem: Detecting Internet Connectivity

### Why Traditional Methods Fail

**Common Approach: Ping DNS Servers**
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8    # Google DNS
ping 1.1.1.1    # Cloudflare DNS
```

**Problems with Ping (ICMP Protocol):**
- ‚ùå Only checks basic network connectivity
- ‚ùå Doesn't verify full HTTP stack (DNS ‚Üí TCP ‚Üí HTTP)
- ‚ùå A device could respond to ping but still fail to load web pages
- ‚ùå Many networks block ICMP packets
- ‚ùå Doesn't confirm actual internet access

**Goal:** Check internet access at the application level like a real HTTP client.

### The Solution: HTTP-based Connectivity Checks

Modern applications use lightweight HTTP endpoints specifically designed for connectivity detection. These endpoints:

- ‚úÖ Verify the complete network path (DNS ‚Üí TCP ‚Üí HTTP)
- ‚úÖ Return minimal data for speed
- ‚úÖ Are hosted on reliable, global infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Work consistently across different network environments

## Using generate_204 Endpoints üéØ

### How generate_204 Works

**Google Chrome's Method:**
```bash
http://google.com/generate_204
https://google.com/generate_204
```

**What Happens:**
- Returns HTTP 204 (No Content) ‚Üí means success with no response body
- Very fast and reliable because it runs on core Google infrastructure
- Confirms the full network path works:
  - DNS resolution
  - TCP connection
  - HTTP response

**Why HTTP 204?**
- No content ‚Üí minimal data usage
- Ideal for quick connectivity checks
- Browsers show blank page (expected behavior)

### Other Google Endpoints
```bash
http://www.gstatic.com/generate_204
http://clients3.google.com/generate_204
```

## Industry-Standard Connectivity Endpoints üåç

### 204 No Content URLs (Recommended)
These endpoints return HTTP 204 and are ideal for connectivity checks:

| Provider | URL | Expected Status | Notes |
|----------|-----|----------------|-------|
| **Google** | `http://google.com/generate_204` | 200, 204 | Most reliable, global infrastructure |
| **Cloudflare** | `http://cp.cloudflare.com/generate_204` | 200, 204 | Fast CDN, excellent worldwide coverage |
| **Microsoft** | `http://edge-http.microsoft.com/captiveportal/generate_204` | 200, 204 | Windows NCSI compatible |
| **Ubuntu** | `http://connectivity-check.ubuntu.com` | 200 | Linux system connectivity checks |

## Why These Endpoints Work Reliably üéØ

### 1. Global Infrastructure
- **Google**: Uses Google's worldwide network infrastructure
- **Cloudflare**: Leverages Cloudflare's global CDN
- **Microsoft**: Microsoft's edge network for Windows compatibility
- **Ubuntu**: Canonical's connectivity check service

### 2. Minimal Resource Usage
- **204 endpoints**: Return no content, minimal bandwidth
- **200 endpoints**: Return tiny files (few bytes)
- **Fast response times**: Optimized for quick checks

### 3. High Availability
- **99.9%+ uptime**: These services are critical infrastructure
- **Multiple data centers**: Redundant across continents
- **DDoS protection**: Protected against network attacks

### 4. Network Compatibility
- **No CORS issues**: Designed for cross-origin requests
- **Works behind proxies**: Compatible with corporate networks
- **Firewall friendly**: Standard HTTP/HTTPS ports

## Testing Endpoints Manually üîç

### Command Line Testing
```bash
# Test Google's endpoint
curl -I http://google.com/generate_204
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

# Test Cloudflare's endpoint
curl -I http://cp.cloudflare.com/generate_204
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

# Test with User-Agent (for picky endpoints)
curl -I http://edge-http.microsoft.com/captiveportal/generate_204 \
  -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
```
